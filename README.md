# Super (In)Secure Bank: A Web Security Demo

This application is for demo purposes. It was built to accompany my work presentation on cookies, sessions, and web security. Every modern browser will probably warn you about how insecure it is and they are not wrong â€“ it was designed to be. Buddy allows users to mount XSS and CSRF attacks.

If the application is still live, you can find it [here](https://super-secure-bank.onrender.com/login). Give it a few seconds for the cold start. And if you do mount an attack, please try not to do anything crazy like kill the processes. It's just a baby.
